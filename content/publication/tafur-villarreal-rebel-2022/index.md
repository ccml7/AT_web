abstract: 'Cañón de las Hermosas is located in a buffer zone of the Páramos Complex
  of the National Natural Park of the same name, located on the eastern flank of the
  Cordillera Central, in the Andean Region of Colombia. Several of the most recurrent
  symptoms in the diagnosis of civil war in the country were concentrated there: poverty
  and inequality, state precariousness-weakness, social and territorial control by
  armed groups, disputes over illegal rents derived from the cultivation and trafficking
  of illicit drugs (ECHANDÍA CASTILLA, 1996, 2000; APONTE GONZÁLEZ, 2019; OBSERVATORIO
  DE PAZ Y DERECHOS HUMANOS, 2020a, 2020b). This extensive zone was catalogued as
  one of the sanctuaries of the FARC guerrillas, which guaranteed security, collected
  taxes, administered justice and regulated coexistence efficiently and effectively
  through punishments, fines and executions. This happened, particularly with the
  protection of the environment, a phenomenon that comes close to what DÁVALOS calls
  \"conservation at gunpoint\" (DÁVALOS, 2001; CENTRO DE ESTUDIOS REGIONALES, 2020b).
  After the weakening of the guerrilla by the pacification operations during the 2000s,
  this conservation work was left in the hands of the civilian population, who denounced
  the destruction of fragile ecosystems due to the militarization of the territory,
  and particularly, the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the Amoyá river, in
  the heart of the Hermosas Canyon. In my work I argue that the Observatorio de Derechos
  Humanos para la Protección del Medio Ambiente and Mesa de la Transparencia del Cañón
  de las Hermosas can be characterized as civil resistance mechanisms, conceived with
  the objective of protecting the population and the environment (TAFUR VILLAREAL,
  2021). Community preferences are explained by the degree of social cooperation expressed
  from the mobilization (protest) and organization capacities, which allowed them
  to join all the autonomous community spaces of the village of Las Hermosas in a
  social platform for direct and indirect dialogue with institutional and political
  actors (among which are included the armed, legal and illegal ones). At the methodological
  level, the research design and methods integrated fieldwork and archival review
  with qualitative analysis, and included field interviews, documentary and archival
  review.'
